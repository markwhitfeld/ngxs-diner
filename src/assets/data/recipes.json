Adjust quantities accordingly if you want a stronger Grand Marnier flavor or less of a coffee flavor\n- If you're uncomfortable with raw eggs, you can buy pasteurized eggs or pasteurize them yourself by immersing the eggs in a 57.2C (135F) water bath for 75 minutes using a sous-vide (which is what we did).\n- Note that the amount of mixture this produces may be too much for your ice cream machine. We use a [Cuisinart ICE-21R](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041A3KPC/?tag=leaverou-20) and we had to do it in 2 batches.

We've tried it on beef, duck, even carbonara! Might be a good idea to make more than is needed for this dish and keep it around.\n- If you have sauce leftovers, it keeps well in the fridge for days in an airtight container.
